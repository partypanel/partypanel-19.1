# Party Panel 19.1 target behavior selection

In this `justifier` file, we describe the `decision`s we take to ultimately select a target behavior for the Party Panel round in 2019 about sleep (Party Panel 19.1 or PP19.1).

Each `decision` is justified with one or more `justification`s, which are each based one one or more `assertion`s, which are each based on one or more `source`s. A `source` can be, for example, a scientific article, a report, or a book; a statement by an individual or the result of an expert consensus procedure; or the results of a quick consulting of target population members. An `assertion` is a statement of a fact, something we believe to be the case (potentially erroneously, but ideally always traceable back to one or more `source`s). A `justification` allows integrating multiple asssertions, and multiple `justification`s can be used to justify a decision.

These four elements are documented in a subset of YAML that can be understood by the `justifier` package, and these YAML fragments are embedded in Markdown files to produce files like this: `jmd` files, or 'justified markdown' files. Each element will generally have the following fields with content:

- `id`: A unique identifier that allows referring to this element. An `id` may never start with a number (i.e. `0-9`) and may only contain:
  - Lowercase Latin letters (`A-Z`);
  - Uppercase Latin letters (`a-z`);
  - Numbers (`0-9`);
  - Underscores (`_`).
- `label`: A label is a human-readable 'name' for a `source`, `assertion`, `justification`, or `decision`. It should briefly describe the core of the element.
- `description`: A description allows for more detailed information about an element.

These `justifier` elements always have to be enclosed by two delimiters, specifically, two lines that contain only three dashed (`---`). There are no constraints for anything outside two delimiters, like this text - but it is strongly advised to stick to Markdown.

Elements can be specified either one by one, in which case they start with naming their type followed by a colon (e.g. `source:`), after which the fields in that element are indented by two spaces, and each field is followed by its value (for longer or complexer strings, it's wise to quote them, to avoid using characters that the YAML parser considers part of the YAML specification).

If you want to specify multiple elements of the same type, you can do this by only listing their name once, and then using dashes and extra indenting by two spaces to create a list (you cannot specify multiple elements with the same name in YAML).
