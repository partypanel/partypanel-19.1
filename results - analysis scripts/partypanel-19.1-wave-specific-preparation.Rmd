### Description of this wave
waveSpecificDescription <- "It was developed to explore the determinants of behaviors related to ...";

### Statement about the random numbers that were assigned
waveSpecificRandomNumberStatement <- "Participants received two random numbers, the first between (and including) 1 and 2, and the second between (and including) 1 and 4. The first random number was used to determine about which behavior participants received questions. If it was 1, participants received questions about enforcing one's own boundaries; if 2, about approaching a friend when under the impression they were crossing somebody's boundaries; and if 3, about disclosing a crossed boundary to one's friends. Participants were told which behavior would be presented to them, and they were able to indicate that they wanted to answer questions about multiple behaviors.

The second random number was not used in this wave. (It was left in the questionnaire as the LimeSurvey questionnaires for new Party Panel waves are copied from the most recent preceding wave, and since two random numbers are often used, it was deemed convenient to simply leave this question in.)";
